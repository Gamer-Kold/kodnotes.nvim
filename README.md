# Kodnotes.nvim

A brain dead simple note taking system; made for my own personal use.
Supports nothing but linking and grepping.

Files in a folder that link to each other, what more could you need?

For some god forsaken reason if you want to use this plugin; telescope and ripgrep 
is a required dependency (used for searching through notes to insert links).

Set vim.g.kodnotes_root if you want to change where the notes are located (by default in ~/notes)

Oh, and its less than a hundred lines of lua code, so maybe maintain a fork yourself if you're gonna use it?
Wouldn't be too difficult, and it'd be a hell of a lot more reliable than relying on lil old me.
